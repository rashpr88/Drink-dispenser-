This project was developed for the Rapid Application Development and Visual Programming Technologies course. It is a stand-alone application that automates the processes associated with a drink dispenser, such as drink selection and payment completion. The system can handle three types of drinks, and customers can place orders based on drink availability and make payments. Upon successful completion of the transaction, the selected drink will be discarded. However, the designed program only focuses on drink selection and customer payment calculations, and it assumes that separate systems handle cash input and output and drink discarding.
